PullResourceAdditions items for use with Dedicated Storage on aCw Servers.

To include the additional items, open the gameusersettings.ini from the server(s) and paste the content from the "PullResourceAdditions.txt" behind "PullResourceAdditions=" (usually near the end of the [SuperStructures] settings section).

EXAMPLE:
PullResourceAdditions=/Game/PrimalEarth/CoreBlueprints/Resources/PrimalItemResource_Pelt.PrimalItemResource_Pelt,/Game/PrimalEarth/Test/PrimalItemConsumable_Egg_Ankylo.PrimalItemConsumable_Egg_Ankylo

It is a comma separated list! No wordwrap! No quotation marks!

The list is as short as possible. As a general rule i have deleted all the stuff we usually don't collect and maintain all the valuable stuff we often use. For example i have deleted dyes, some ammo/explosives, soups, traps, stackable weapons, seeds, eggs and kibbles. On the other hand i have included for example trophies, alpha trophies and some usefull ammo.
The file "Overview_DONT_USE_TO_COPYnPASTE.txt" shows all entries in readable formatting.
